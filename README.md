# emotion-detect
Emotion Detector: This is a fully futuristic tool that can detect user's emotion gender and race also can detect age but that might not accurate.

# Modern Libraries used:
Here I have used openCV, deepface library and tensorflow to detect and analyze emotions, which works accurately.
OpenCV helps to open webcam and detect face, deepface is a pre-trained model that has human like emotions understanding capacity and tensorflow is used to analyze human face and neural processing.

# How to use:
first open command prompt and type pip install -r requirements.txt, this will install all the libraries and then ready to go make sure you have enough space and RAM and proper webcam.
Then, ready to go..
